Project 2 readme

All the code for this project is in a file called `main.c`, since part 2 just builds on part 1. To compile this project, use the `make` command. This creates an executable called `main`. Te input is read in using scanf(), so the user can run `./main` and input the lines manually, or run `./main < test/general.txt`, where test/general.txt is one example of a test file.

Our project's eviction policy is a random eviction policy.
